# Mono Developer Documentation

***Hi, and welcome to our developer documentation site. We imagine you want to create your own mono applications? Well, you can skip all the talking and just start off with: [Getting started installing the framework](getting-started/install.md), and you are already half way.***

### What to find here?

Here on our developer site, we will collect all learning resources about mono. You will find initial getting started guides, followed by tutorials on specific topics, in-depth articles and last (but not least) the API reference docs.

*Right now we are in the process of writing the documentation, so you might encounter broken links, typos, bad gramma and a lot of misspellings.*

We prioritize to get as much text published fast, instead of keeping our cards close - and only disclose corporately validated content. We hope you like our desicion. Anyway - should you encounter anything you would like to correct - see: [Contributing](#contribute)

## Content

 * [Getting Started](getting-started/getting_started.md)
 * [Tutorials](tutorials/tutorials.md)
 * [In-Depth Articles](articles/articles.md)
 * [Integrating with MonoKiosk](kiosk/monokiosk.md)
 * [API Reference](reference/reference.md)


### Implementation status

As with this site, the software is also being finished right now. The *current status* page include a list of all the planned features of the framework - and their implementation status:

 * **[Current Status](current-status.md)**

### What is Mono anyway?

Haven't you heard the word? Mono is an embedded hardware platform that brings all the goods from [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc) and [mbed](http://developer.mbed.org) to a whole new level! No fiddling with voltage levels, open-drain vs pull-up configurations. We take care of all this low-level stuff for you. You just focus on building your application, taking advantage of all the build-in hardware functionalities - like:

* Arm Cortex-M3 MCU
* Touch display
* Battery
* Wifi
* Bluetooth
* Accelerometer
* Temperature Sensor
* SD Card
* General Purpose 3.5mm jack connector

On this developer documentation site, you learn how to use all these features through our high-level API.
